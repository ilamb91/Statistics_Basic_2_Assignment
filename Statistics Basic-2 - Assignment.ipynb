    "- Mean: Mean, here the arithmetic mean is the most used measure of central tendency. With both discrete and continuous data set, a mean can be obtained. To obtain the mean of a set of numbers, you have to sum up all the numbers and then divide it using the total numbers. In short, it is taking out the average of all numbers. It can also be said that it is the ratio of the sum of all observations to the total no of observations. In pre-primary classes, it was introduced as average to the students while in higher classes we came to know that it is also known as Mean. \n",

    "- Median: When you arrange a given set of numbers from smaller to biggest, the middle number is said to be the median. Arrange any given series in either ascending or descending order or the middle value then is termed as the median. To find the median the data can be arranged in either descending order or ascending order. In geometry, it is defined as the centre or midpoint of a polygon. \n",

    "- Mode: The most repeated number in a given set of observations is the mode or it can also be said that the Number or Value which have the highest frequency in a given series of numbers. It is also known as the modal value. It is a part of 3 central tendencies apart from the median and Mean. It is the highest bar if presented in a histogram or a chart form.  If there is no repeated number in a given series then no Mode will exist for that series.\n",

The measures of the mean are not enough to describe the data and its nature. We also need to measure the dispersion in the data with respect to different statistics of the data.
